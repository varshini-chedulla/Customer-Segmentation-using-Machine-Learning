# Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning


The objective of this project is to build a flexible machine learning model that can segregate customers of a businessinto different groups based on the businessrequirement. Knowing the differences
between customer groups, it’s easier to make strategic decisions regarding product growth and marketing.
Nowadays Customer segmentation became very popular method for dividing company’s customers for
retaining customers and making profit out of them, in the following study customers of different of
organizations are classified on the basis of their behavioral characteristics such as spending and income,
by taking behavioral aspects into consideration makes these methods an efficient one as compares to others.

For this classification a machine algorithm named K-Means Clustering, Mean-Shift, DBSCAN
algorithms are used and based on the behavioral characteristic’s customers are classified. Formed
clusters help the company to target individual customers and advertise the content to them through
marketing campaigns and social media sites which they are really interested in. These days, you can
personalize everything. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. But, for business, this is actually a great thing.

It creates a lot of space for healthy competition and opportunities for companies to get creative
about how they acquire and retain customers. One of the fundamental steps towards better
personalization is customer segmentation. This is where personalization starts, and proper segmentation
will help you make decisions regarding new features, new products, pricing, marketing strategies, even
things like in-app recommendations
